Pros:
dont need contiguous blocks of data
uses up left over space
ordered
removing or inserting at first element is O(1)
inserting and deleting elements is simpler than an array
flexible size
appending is O(1)

doubly linked lists technically have searchups of O(n/2) time
doubly linked lists can search backwards

Cons:
more memory required
searching, inserting, deleting is O(n) if not at the first element
scattered memory
more memory
slow lookup

doubly linked lists require more memory than singly
doubly linked lists are more complex to implement
