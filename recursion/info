-useful for repeated subtasks to do
-need to hold onto all call stacks and allocate when when a new call is made
lots of memory is used and can cause a stack overflow
-needs a base case or a stop point
1. identify base case
2. identify the recursive case
3. get closer and closer and return when needed
