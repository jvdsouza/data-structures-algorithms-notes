Pros:
- easy to store data
- contiguous
- can add and delete to the end of this data structure with O(1) time complexity

Cons:
- needs to be ordered in memory and contiguous
- static arrays require memory reallocation to add data to, causes .push() to be O(n)
- inserting and deleting anywhere not in the last item means O(n) time complexity
