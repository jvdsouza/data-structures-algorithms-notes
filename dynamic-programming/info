It is an optimisation technique

Do you have something you can cache? use dynamic programming

dynamic programming is a buzzword turned into a technique

Memoization ~~~~ Caching
caching: way to store values so you can use them later on
memoization: specific way of caching involves caching the return value
of a function based on its parameters. If the parameter of the function
doesn't change, it's memoized. Collects solutions to solved problems
so you dont have to resolve it

Dynamic programming = divide and conquer + memoization
To see if a problem can use dynamic programming:
1. Can be divided into subproblems - is it a tree like structure?
2. Recursive solution <---------------'
3. Are there repetitive subproblems
4. Memoize subproblems
5. Demand a raise from your boss
