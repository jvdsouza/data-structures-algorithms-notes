-one of the most used data structures when used to modelling real life
-set of values that are related in a pair wise fashion
-each item is a node or vertex
-each is connected with edges

types:
-directed
--one way
-undirected
--two ways
-weighted
--values in edges
--used to calculate fastest paths
-unweighted
--no values in edges
-cyclic
--when you have nodes connected in a circular fashion
--popular in weighted graphs
-acyclic
--nodes not connected in circular fashion

Direct cyclic graphs are common (abbreviated to DAG)

shown as adjacency matrix and adjacent list and edge list

Pros:
-useful for displaying relationships
Cons:
-Scaling is difficult
